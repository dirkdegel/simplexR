# Simplex Algorithm in R


The Wikipedia articles gives a good starting point if you would like to learn more about [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) and the [simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) (simplex method).

I'm always happy to get bug reports or feedback.
